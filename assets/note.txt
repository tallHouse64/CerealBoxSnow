To make Cereal Box Snow as portable as possible,
 images are directly stored in the executable
 instead of loading from a file at runtime. This
 means if any image file is changed, the source
 code copy of the image will need updating.

Commands used to update header files from images:
 ./convert font.png font.h fontData
 ./convert drws-lib.png drwslib.h drwslib
