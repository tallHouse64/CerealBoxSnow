## Features
This program doesn't have many features.
There is a slider to control the number of particles simulated.

It can simulate two things:
- Snow
- Fire

## Dependencies
This program uses Drws-lib for graphics, input and output. Drws-lib uses SDL2 as an optional dependency.

## System requirements
It runs great on a small laptop 4 Core 1.1Ghz CPU with 4GB RAM.
It would probably run fine on a potato.
