# Cereal Box Snow
This is just a snow sim I wanted to make, it is pixel art style snow in 2D. The snow randomly moves left or right each frame and goes down a random amount.
I could watch it for hours.
I also wanted to release it in time for Christmas and 20th December is ok. Merry Christmas!

## Features
So far it has one feature, a slider to choose how many snow particles are used.

## Dependencies
There is one dependency on drws-lib. Drws-lib can optionally work on top of SDL2, which it does in this case.

## System requirements
It runs great on a small laptop 4 Core 1.1Ghz CPU with 4GB RAM.
It would probably run fine on a potato.
