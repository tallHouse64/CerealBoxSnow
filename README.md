# Cereal Box Snow
This is just a snow sim I wanted to make, it is pixel art style snow in 2D. The snow randomly moves left or right each frame and goes down a random amount.
I could watch it for hours.
I also wanted to release it in time for Christmas and 20th December is ok. Merry Christmas btw.

## Features
So far it has one, a slider to choose how many snow particles are used.

## Dependancies
It uses a library I'm working on which hopfuly I'll release soon, it's a single header file library originaly called D which needs renaming before release because D is used in another library called Dlib.
The library itself depends on SDL2, but it is made to be portable so it can hopfuly work on DS and other things, more details on it's release.

## System requirements
It runs great on a small laptop 4 Core 1.1Ghz CPU with 4GB RAM.
This part sounds like a joke, I think it would run fine on a potato.
